				<h3>What is github?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						Github is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store,
						manage and share their code. It uses Git software, providing the distributed
						version control of access control, bug tracking, software feature requests,
						task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.
						Headquartered in California, it has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h3>What is git cloning?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						You can clone a repository from GitHub.com to your local computer, or to a
						codespace, to make it easier to fix merge conflicts, add or remove files,
						and push larger commits. When you clone a repository, you copy the repository
						from GitHub.com to your local machine, or to a remote virtual machine when you
						create a codespace.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h3>What is forking</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the
						original “upstream” repository. Forks are often used to iterate on ideas or
						changes before they are proposed back to the upstream repository, such as in
						open source projects or when a user does not have write access to the upstream
						repository.
					</p>
					<p>
						For example, you can use forks to propose changes related to fixing a bug.
						Rather than logging an issue for a bug you have found, you can:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Fork the repository.</li>
						<li>Make the fix.</li>
						<li>Submit a pull request to the project owner.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<h3>What is a repository in Github?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. It's a place where you can
						store your code, your files, and each file's revision history. Repositories
						can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
					</p>
					<p>
						When you created your new repository, you initialized it with a README file.
						README files are a great place to describe your project in more detail, or add
						some documentation such as how to install or use your project. The contents of
						your README file are automatically shown on the front page of your repository.
					</p>
